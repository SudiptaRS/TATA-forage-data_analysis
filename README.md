# Online Retail Store Analytics Project

## Background
An online retail store has engaged you as a consultant to analyze their data and deliver actionable insights to the CEO and CMO. The business has been performing strongly, and management seeks to identify key drivers of revenue to inform strategic planning for the upcoming year. They are interested in metrics from both operational and marketing perspectives and aim to expand by focusing on high-performing areas and understanding demographic trends in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO is scheduled for next month, requiring you to prepare analytics and insights to evaluate current performance and recommend metrics for expansion decisions. Thinking from a business leaderâ€™s perspective will enhance your analysis and presentation of insights.

### Questions for CEO I prepared
1. What is the overall health of the business based on website traffic, social media presence, and sales figures?
2. Considering the cost of goods sold, what is the profit margin (gross and net) we are currently achieving?
3. In which regions (countries) is there potential for increased sales?
4. What is the satisfaction level of customers with delivery services post-purchase?

### Questions for CMO I prepared
1. What new social media trends can improve marketing efforts?
2. What is the current customer acquisition cost, and how can it be reduced?
3. What are the demographics of our target audience, and how effectively are our marketing campaigns reaching them?
4. How effective are our current marketing channels in driving website traffic and generating leads?


## Task Overview
Your task is is to create visualizations addressing four specific questions from the CEO and CMO using either Tableau or Power BI. Data is provided in the resources section below. Both tools offer free trials (see download instructions in resources).

### Data Cleanup
Before analysis, clean the data as follows:
- **Quantity Check:** Exclude entries with quantities below 1 unit.
- **Unit Price Check:** Exclude entries with unit prices below $0.

Use conditional formulas (e.g., `IF` statements) or data transformation methods to filter out invalid data. Resources for these techniques are provided below. Ensure data is cleaned before proceeding with visualizations.

### Visualization Requirements
- Create each visual on a separate tab, labeled with the question number (e.g., "Question 1").
- Save files in `.twbx` format for Tableau or `.pbix` format for Power BI (see saving instructions in resources).
- Upload completed files as specified.
- Refer to the "Visuals Hints" document in resources if needed.

#### Question 1 (CEO)
- **Objective:** Display a time series of revenue data for 2011, broken down by month.
- **Details:** Highlight seasonal trends to aid in forecasting for the next year. The CEO wants to explore the reasons behind these trends.

#### Question 2 (CMO)
- **Objective:** Show the top 10 countries by revenue, excluding the United Kingdom.
- **Details:** Include both revenue and quantity sold for each country.

#### Question 3 (CMO)
